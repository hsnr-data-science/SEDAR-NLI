1,Theory of General Relativity,Albert Einstein,1915,Describes the gravitational force as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.  
2,Quantum Mechanics,Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger,1920s,The fundamental theory of physics that describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles.  
3,Special Relativity,Albert Einstein,1905,Describes the relationship between space and time, asserting that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers.  
4,Big Bang Theory,Georges Lemaître, Edwin Hubble,1927,The prevailing cosmological model explaining the observable universe's origin from a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago.  
5,Standard Model of Particle Physics,Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, Steven Weinberg,1970s,A theory concerning the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear interactions, which mediate the dynamics of known subatomic particles.  
6,Electromagnetism,James Clerk Maxwell,1864,Describes how electric and magnetic fields are generated by charges, currents, and changes of the fields.  
7,Heliocentrism,Nicolaus Copernicus,1543,The astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System.  
8,General Theory of Wave-Particle Duality,Louis de Broglie,1924,Proposes that every particle or quantum entity exhibits both wave and particle properties.  
9,Quantum Field Theory,Paul Dirac, Richard Feynman,1940s,The theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quantum many-body systems in condensed matter physics.  
10,Chaos Theory,Edward Lorenz,1972,Describes the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, leading to long-term prediction impossibilities.  
11,Superconductivity,Heike Kamerlingh Onnes,1911,A phenomenon where a material can conduct electricity without resistance below a certain temperature.  
12,Generalized Theory of Gravitation,Albert Einstein,1945,An attempt to unify the general theory of relativity with electromagnetism.  
13,Plate Tectonics,Alfred Wegener,1912,The theory explaining the movement of Earth's lithosphere which has led to the formation of continents and ocean basins.  
14,Quantum Chromodynamics,Murray Gell-Mann, Harald Fritzsch,1972,The theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, which is a fundamental force describing the interactions of subatomic particles.  
15,Photoelectric Effect,Albert Einstein,1905,The phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a material when it absorbs light or electromagnetic radiation.  
16,Black Hole Theory,John Michell, Pierre-Simon Laplace,1783,A region of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.  
17,String Theory,Gabriele Veneziano, Leonard Susskind,1970,A theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings.  
18,Generalized Theory of Elasticity,Augustin-Louis Cauchy,1822,Describes how solid materials deform and become internally stressed due to prescribed loading conditions.  
19,Theory of Evolution,Charles Darwin,1859,Explains the diversity of life on Earth through the process of natural selection.  
20,Anthropic Principle,Brandon Carter,1973,The philosophical consideration that observations of the universe must be compatible with the conscious life that observes it.
