Most parameters are optional and not needed in most cases. Only use them if there is really a need. The most important parameter is the query string. Think about one good query keyword or multiple that will return the desired results based on the initial user query. Use the stem of the keyword you want to use. This will lead to more results, for example: sale instead of sales, chem instead of chemistry or chemical. Only using chemical would not return results with chemistry. If the query contains a specific dataset name, use the exact name as search query instead of keywords.

====================================================================================================
Here is one example of a search query:
"Find all datasets about 'sales'."

Output:
{{"query": "sales", "advanced_search_parameters": {{}}}}

Another example:
"Show me all datasets created by testuser@example.com"

Output:
{{"query": "", "advanced_search_parameters": {{"author": "testuser@example.com"}}}}

And here are the possible configurations:
{automl_configurations}

Now based on the info about possible configurations, generate the parameters for creating an AutoML notebook.

The output should be in this JSON format:
{{
    "library_name": "<library_name>",
    "datasets": [<dataset_cache_id1>, <dataset_cache_id2>, ...],
    "title": "<title>",
    "description": "<description>",
    "target_column": "<target_column>",
    "data_type": "<data_type>",
    "task_type": "<task_type>",
    "problem_type": "<problem_type>",
    "user_params": <user_params dict>,
    "is_public": <true/false>,
    "include_llm_features": <true/false>,
    "create_with_llm": <true/false>
}}

You can find the dataset IDs in the object cache.
{object_cache}

Here is an example:
User query:
Create a machine learning experiment for text similarity using the dataset 'sales_data'. Use the column "description" as the target column.

Object Cache:
{{
    "_DATASET_3n1k5jld": Dataset(id="abc123xyz"),
    ...
}}

Output:
{{
    "library_name": "AutoGluon",
    "datasets": ["_DATASET_3n1k5jld"],
    "title": "Text Similarity Experiment",
    "description": "Experiment to find text similarity",
    "target_column": "description",
    "data_type": "text",
    "task_type": "similarity",
    "problem_type": "similarity",
    "user_params": {{}},
    "is_public": false,
    "include_llm_features": false,
    "create_with_llm": false
}}

Now generate the correct parameters for the user query. Output STRICTLY ONLY JSON.

Output:

semantic_labeling_prompt_template = """
Your task is to assign semantic labels from an ontology to a dataset based on the preview of the dataset and the available labels in the ontology.

For this you have to give structured output in the following JSON format:

    "column_name2": "<label_name2>",
    ...

===============================

Here is an example:
Dataset preview:

      "PriceUSD": "$24,500",
      "EngineType": "Gasoline",

    }}
  ],

    "PriceUSD",
    "EngineType"
  ]

Available labels in the ontology:

Dataset
Automobile

Diesel

Output:

    "EngineType": "AutomobileEngine"
}}

===============================

Here is the preview of the dataset:
{dataset_preview}

Here are the available labels in the ontology:
{available_labels}

Now assign the semantic labels to the columns in the dataset based on the preview and the available labels in the ontology. Output STRICTLY ONLY JSON.

}}

Note how first, in the SELECT, we specify the variables of the columns to display.
Then the first section in the where selects the index columns using the dbo:XX Tags from the DBPedia ontology. So each Tag is the same as in the Mapping for the index column.
Then the columns for the SELECT are selected in the next section based on the index column, and again using the labels from the Mapping.
And lastly the join pairs are defined in both directions between the index columns.
===============================

Make sure, you define all join pairs in the query, e.g. when you join 2 datasets, there should be 2 (both directions) and when you join 3 datasets, there are 4 join pairs (2 directions for the first join and 2 directions for the second).
Output STRICLTY ONLY THE QUERY so it can be used directly.

Now generate the SPARQL query based this user query:
{initial_query}

and this RML mapping:
{mapping_file}

Output (ONLY THE QUERY):
